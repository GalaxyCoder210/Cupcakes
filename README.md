#Hi!  Lets look at photos of delicious cupcakes!

First,a decription of what cupcakes are...

Cupcakes are almost like cakes,except they are smaller and come in a cup(cupcake liner)!!!
They come in many different flavors,including chocolate,vanilla,and many,many more.
Instead of layers with frosing in between them,the frosting is spread or piped on top.
INGENIUS!!!!!!!!

Now,the photos....
